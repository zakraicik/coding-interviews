## Overview

Gauntlet is a leading risk management platform designed to help DeFi protocols scale safely.  
It combines economic modeling, simulations, and quantitative analysis to optimize risk parameters, safeguard assets, and drive sustainable growth for protocols, chains, and on-chain treasuries.  
Gauntlet protects billions of dollars across various protocols by offering data-driven solutions tailored to each projectâ€™s unique risks and goals.

### Key Use Cases:

- **Economic Risk Management**: Gauntlet simulates market conditions to identify and mitigate risks across DeFi protocols, ensuring they can handle extreme volatility.
- **Cross-Protocol Risk Monitoring**: By modeling interactions between protocols, Gauntlet helps maintain stability and protects against cascading risks.
- **Protocol Growth Optimization**: Gauntlet drives growth by optimizing liquidity, token incentives, and governance mechanisms, increasing capital efficiency while managing risk.
